## Welcome!

This dApp has been created to demonstrate the integration of Masca. This is a part of our workshop at EthCC[6].

Simply by using our Masca Connector SDK ([GitHub](https://github.com/blockchain-lab-um/masca/tree/develop/packages/connector), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockchain-lab-um/masca-connector)), you can take advantage of Masca's ability to manage users' decentralized identities.

The live website can be accessed [here](https://ethcc.masca.io), where you can get your very special **Masca EthCC[6] Workshop Verifiable Credential**.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Ubuntu and Cabin, a custom Google Font.
